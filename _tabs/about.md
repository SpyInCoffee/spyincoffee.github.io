Yggdrasys /ˈɪɡdrəsɪs/

A play on the word Yggdrasil, the sacred tree in Norse mythology central to the cosmos and connecting the Nine Worlds. Yggdrasys fuses Norse myth with modern technology, drawing a parallel between Yggdrasil linking realms and an IT administrator connecting and managing complex systems.
